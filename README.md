# NOTICE
Dear users and developers,

This project is currently under heavy development, and as such, no usable content is available. The first release version should be available shortly (I hope). If you're brave enough, consider checking out our [latest Alpha release](https://github.com/haximilian/woodsman/tree/unstable) (use at your own risk).

## Getting Started
First, install Woodsman into your project. The recommended way of doing this is using [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) with the `--save` option to save *Woodsman* as a dependency in your `package.json` file:

> npm install --save woodsman

If you haven't already, install [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/) as *Woodsman* is built to follow the [AMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_module_definition) specification:

> npm install --save requirejs
